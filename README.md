# Mini Spool

A tiny spool (slightly larger than a household bobbin) that can be easily printed without supports.

The spools are printed in two pieces that interlock and are retained closed with an M3 screw and nut. You can also simply glue the two halves together if you wish to retain the center hole for another purpose or do not want to use hardware.
